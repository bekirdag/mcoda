# Agent Prompts

This directory holds pre-flight prompts for the agents working in this repository. Each prompt is a concise, self-contained briefing that tells an agent how to get oriented, what to inspect before acting, and how to deliver useful outputs.

Add new prompts when we introduce a new agent role or workflow. Keep every prompt grounded in the current repo layout (`README.md`, `docs/`, `openapi/`, `packages/`) and prefer clear checklists over vague guidance.
